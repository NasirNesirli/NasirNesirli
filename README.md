**Pinned projects**

1. Production Snakemake pipeline predicting multidrug resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae from whole-genome sequencing data. Compares four ML architectures — XGBoost, LightGBM, 1D CNN, DNABERT-2 — across four antibiotic classes using rigorous temporal validation (pre-2023 training, 2023–2024 testing). SHAP analysis identifies biologically interpretable resistance determinants. Tree-based models outperform deep learning under real-world dataset constraints. Built for HPC and Docker. MSc Bioinformatics dissertation, University of Birmingham, 2025.
